SmartShopping
=============

SmartShopping is a service that is designed to provide consumers with data about their shopping habits and how they relate to environmental, economical and social sustainability. What makes SmartShopping special in this regard is that rather than asking the user to sit down and input all of their purchases, it will be done automatically for them. We imagine a scenario in which a consumer goes to their local food store, uses their membership card and the information about that specific purchase is immeadiately made available to them through either a web service or mobile application. The data would be displayed in such a way that it is easy for the user to analyze their own habits, both long- and short-term, and find not only their weak points but also areas at which they excel. Additionally functionality for saving receipts digitally reduces the need for physical ones.

This would obviously have to be developed in tight cooperation with either a single or a group of stores. Besides that there are also several legal issues regarding information storage and use that would have to be resolved in order to make this idea a reality. With that in mind we choose to make a functional prototype.
